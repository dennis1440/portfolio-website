        <h1>Life of John F. Kennedy</h1>
        <p>
          John F. Kennedy, (born May 29, 1917, Brookline, Mass., U.S.—died Nov.
          22, 1963, Dallas, Texas), 35th president of the U.S. (1961–63).<h3> The
          son of Joseph P. Kennedy, he graduated from Harvard University in 1940
          and joined the navy the following year.<h3> He commanded a patrol torpedo
          (PT) boat in World War II and was gravely injured in an attack by a
          Japanese destroyer; he was later decorated for heroism. Elected to the
          U.S. House of Representatives in 1946 and the U.S. Senate in 1952, he
          supported social-welfare legislation and became increasingly committed
          to civil rights; in foreign affairs, he supported the Cold War
          policies of the Truman administration.<h3> In 1960 he won the Democratic
          nomination for president, beating out Lyndon B. Johnson, who became
          his running mate. In his acceptance speech Kennedy declared, “We stand
          on the edge of a New Frontier”; thereafter the phrase “New Frontier”
          was associated with his programs.<h3> After a vigorous campaign managed by
          his brother Robert F. Kennedy and aided financially by his father, he
          narrowly defeated the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon. He was the
          youngest person and the first Roman Catholic elected president. In his
          inaugural address he called on Americans to “ask not what your country
          can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.”<h3> His legislative
          program, including massive income-tax cuts and a sweeping civil-rights
          measure, received little support in the Congress, though he did win
          approval of the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress.In 1961 he
          committed the U.S. to land a man on the Moon by the end of the decade.
          In foreign affairs he approved a plan drawn up during the Eisenhower
          administration to land an invasion force of Cuban exiles on their
          homeland, but the Bay of Pigs invasion (1961) was a fiasco.<h3> Determined
          to combat the spread of communism in Asia, he sent military advisers
          and other assistance to South Vietnam. During the Cuban missile crisis
          (1962) he imposed a naval blockade on Cuba and demanded that the
          Soviet Union remove its nuclear missiles from the island.<h3> In 1963 he
          successfully concluded the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty with Britain and
          the Soviet Union. In November 1963, while riding in a motorcade in
          Dallas, he was assassinated by a sniper, allegedly Lee Harvey Oswald.<h3>
          The killing is considered the most notorious political murder of the
          20th century. Kennedy’s youth, energy, and charming family brought him
          world adulation and sparked the idealism of a generation, for whom the
          Kennedy White House became known as “Camelot.” Revelations about his
          powerful family and his personal life, especially concerning his
          extramarital affairs, tainted his image in later years.
